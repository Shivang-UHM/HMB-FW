----------
DESCRIPTION:
This project contains spartan6 FPGA VHDL firmware for the SCROD REVA5 and HODODSCOPE daughtercard. Each board has an ISE 
project which can be found in their corresponding sub-directories. Scripts to configure and test the boards and their firmware
can be found in the scripts/ folder. 

For more informatation on how to use the scripts see the Resources section of mRICH site:

PROJECT STATUS: 
  - Work in progress: 
  - Fixing ethernet module (needs to be added to repo)
  - Integrating ByteLine protocol (needs to be added to repo)
  - PMT board firmware (needs to be added to repo)

*************************************VERSION CONTROL POLICY**********************************************************
To access project from nathankp's online repo, please fork into your own github account and clone into your local repo.
To contribute to the project, submit a pull request. DO NOT PUSH TO THE REMOTE MASTER UNTIL CHANGES HAVE BEEN APPROVED!

COMMITTING CHANGES:   
When you reach a logical stopping point (i.e. when you made functional changes) it's time to commit your changes. 
Commit allows you to save a snapshot of your project. It allows you to create check points that you can return
to if you get stuck. 
	Here's how you commit in git bash: 
		1. stage your changes inwith "git add ." 
		2. then commit in git: 
		        - If you are making small changes use "git commit -m <Short message>" (see next section) 
			- When you made a big change or a lot of changes: use "git commit " 
			  and add a full commit message (see next section) 
COMMIT MESSAGES:
 - Short messages: Capitalize first word in message. Make an action statement (ex. "Fix syntax errors")
 - Full messages: Below is a suggested template for commit messages. Following this template will make 
   it easier to document revisions and retrace steps. 
  
  {Message Template} 
  ----------------------------------------------
   <Insert commit title here>
   <Author>
   Changes:
      - <Filename> <List Changes>

   Issues addressed by changes:
      + <Issue/need>: <explanation>

   Comments:
    <Describe remaining issues and bugs>
    <List activities other than development (i.e. Hardware tests, simulation, hardware design, documentation)>
   ---------------------------------------------
   You can add this template to your ~/.gitconfig use it with all commit messages automatically: 
   	1. (git bash) vim ~/.gitconfig
	2. (in vim or other txt editor add the following lines, then exit) 
	   [commit] 
	   	template = ~/.gitmessage
	   
	3. create the file ~/.gitmessage with vim 
		(git bash) vim ~/.gitmessage 
	4. (in vim copy template, replace <Author> with your name, then exit)
	5. ALL DONE!
