Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 41 IOs, 33 are locked
   and 8 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 
ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <CLOCK_FANOUT/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <ila0_trig0<8>>, that is driving
   the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: U_ila_pro_0/U0/I_TQ0.G_TW[8].U_TQ.D; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
