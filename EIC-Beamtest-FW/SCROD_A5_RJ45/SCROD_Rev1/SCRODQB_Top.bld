WARNING:ConstraintSystem - TNM : D_CLK was distributed to a DCM but new TNM
   constraints were not derived. This TNM is used in the following user groups
   or specifications:
   <TIMESPEC TS_J_TO_D = FROM "J_CLK" TO "D_CLK" TIG;>
   <TIMESPEC TS_D_TO_J = FROM "D_CLK" TO "J_CLK" TIG;>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'MASTER_CLK_P', used in period specification
   'TS_MASTER_CLK_P', was traced into DCM_SP instance
   CLK_FANOUT_1TO2/dcm_sp_inst. The following new TNM groups and period
   specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_internal_data_clk = PERIOD "internal_data_clk"
   TS_MASTER_CLK_P / 0.2 HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'MASTER_CLK_P', used in period specification
   'TS_MASTER_CLK_P', was traced into DCM_SP instance
   CLK_FANOUT_1TO2/dcm_sp_inst. The following new TNM groups and period
   specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLK0: <TIMESPEC TS_CLK_FANOUT_1TO2_clk0 = PERIOD "CLK_FANOUT_1TO2_clk0"
   TS_MASTER_CLK_P HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'internal_data_clk', used in period
   specification 'TS_internal_data_clk', was traced into DCM_SP instance
   comm_process/U_ClockGenByteLink/dcm_sp_inst. The following new TNM groups and
   period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_comm_process_U_ClockGenByteLink_clkfx = PERIOD

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (46.882) was
   detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "comm_process/U_ClockGenByteLink/dcm_sp_inst".  This does not match the
   PERIOD constraint value (40 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the
   non-default attribute value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for DCM output clocks.
