Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   1

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "SC_DC_CLK_N<0>" has an illegal IOSTANDARD
   value.  The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can
   not use differential IOSTANDARD value LVDS_25.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:328 - Block
   comm_process/ETH_MODULE/udp_1/eth_inst/trimac_fifo_block/trimac_block/axi4_li
   te_ipif/axi_lite_top/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/I_DECODER/MEM_DECODE_GEN[0].GEN_FOR_M
   ULTI_CS.MEM_SELECT_I is not a recognized logical block. The mapper will
   continue to process the design but there may be design problems if this block
   does not get trimmed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network dc_no_response<3> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 473 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   dc_no_response<2>,
   dc_no_response<1>,
   dc_no_response<0>,
   N3,
   icon_control0<35>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:564 - The following environment variables are currently set:
INFO:MapLib:591 - XIL_MAP_LOCWARN 	Value: XIL_MAP_LOCWARN
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
