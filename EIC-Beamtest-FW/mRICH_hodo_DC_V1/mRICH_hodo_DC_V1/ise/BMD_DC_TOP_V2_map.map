WARNING:Pack:2549 - The register "TARGETX_TRIGGER_LOGIC/coin_buf_1_1" has the
   property IOB=TRUE, but was not packed into the OLOGIC component. The output
   signal for register symbol TARGETX_TRIGGER_LOGIC/coin_buf_1_1 requires
   general routing to fabric, but the register can only be routed to ILOGIC,
   IODELAY, and IOB.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ][10681_2082 is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
