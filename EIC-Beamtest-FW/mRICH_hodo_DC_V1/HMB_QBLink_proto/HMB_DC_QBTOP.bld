WARNING:ConstraintSystem - TNM : D_CLK was distributed to a DCM but new TNM
   constraints were not derived. This TNM is used in the following user groups
   or specifications:
   <TIMESPEC TS_J_TO_D = FROM "J_CLK" TO "D_CLK" TIG;>
   <TIMESPEC TS_D_TO_J = FROM "D_CLK" TO "J_CLK" TIG;>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'SYSCLK_P', used in period specification
   'TS_SSTIN_P', was traced into PLL_ADV instance PLL_ADV. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the PLL_ADV output(s): 
   CLKOUT1: <TIMESPEC TS_CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout1 = PERIOD "CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout1"
   TS_SSTIN_P / 2.5 HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'SYSCLK_P', used in period specification
   'TS_SSTIN_P', was traced into PLL_ADV instance PLL_ADV. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the PLL_ADV output(s): 
   CLKOUT0: <TIMESPEC TS_CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout0 = PERIOD "CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout0"
   TS_SSTIN_P HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout0', used in period
   specification 'TS_CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout0', was traced into DCM_SP instance
   comm_process/U_ClockGenByteLink/dcm_sp_inst. The following new TNM groups and
   period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_comm_process_U_ClockGenByteLink_clkfx = PERIOD
   "comm_process_U_ClockGenByteLink_clkfx" TS_CLOCK_FANOUT_clkout0 / 5 HIGH 50%>

WARNING:NgdBuild:1345 - The constraint <TIMESPEC "TS_sys_clk" = PERIOD
   "SYSCLK_P" 40 ns HIGH 50 %;> [HMB_QBLink.ucf(12)] is overridden by the
   constraint <TIMESPEC "TS_SSTIN_P" = PERIOD "SYSCLK_P" 31.25 ns HIGH 50 %;>
   [HMB_QBLink.ucf(18)]. The overriden constraint usually comes from the input
   netlist or ncf files. Please set XIL_NGDBUILD_CONSTR_OVERRIDE_ERROR to
   promote this message to an error.

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (46.882) was
   detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "comm_process/U_ClockGenByteLink/dcm_sp_inst".  This does not match the
   PERIOD constraint value (31.25 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use
   the non-default attribute value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for DCM output clocks.
WARNING:NgdBuild:1440 - User specified non-default attribute value (40) was
   detected for the CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute on PLL "PLL_ADV".  This does not
   match the PERIOD constraint value (31.25 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation
   will use the PERIOD constraint value.  This could result in incorrect
   uncertainty calculated for PLL output clocks.
