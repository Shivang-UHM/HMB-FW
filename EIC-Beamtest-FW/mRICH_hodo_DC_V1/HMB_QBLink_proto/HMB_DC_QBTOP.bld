INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'SYSCLK_P', used in period specification
   'TS_sys_clk', was traced into DCM_SP instance
   comm_process/U_ClockGenByteLink/dcm_sp_inst. The following new TNM groups and
   period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_comm_process_U_ClockGenByteLink_clkfx = PERIOD
   "comm_process_U_ClockGenByteLink_clkfx" TS_sys_clk / 5 HIGH 50%>

Done...

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (46.882) was
   detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "comm_process/U_ClockGenByteLink/dcm_sp_inst".  This does not match the
   PERIOD constraint value (40 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the
   non-default attribute value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for DCM output clocks.
